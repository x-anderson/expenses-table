## Tipalti React Starter Template

This is a simplified React starter template configured using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.

It has minimal dependencies and configuration to allow for easy installation and to allow the candidate to make their own decisions about styling, external libraries and other tooling.

You are free to make changes to the template but please be aware that those reviewing your work will need to be able to install and run it locally without difficulty.
